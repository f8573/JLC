=== CSV copy ===

Source: build\\reports\\caqr_bench.csv
Destination: build\\reports\\caqr_bench_CAQR_wy.csv
Action: Copied the produced CSV to the destination path.

=== Notes ===
- Stopped on failure? No — both assemble and test completed successfully.
- If you want the CSV to contain only CAQR strategy rows, run the microbench with a CAQR-specific configuration or post-process the CSV accordingly.
